From: Camiel Ayari <cayarius@gmail.com>=0ASubject: Animation for your compa=
ny.=0A=0AMessage Body:=0AHi there! My name is Camiel and I'm from Studio Ou=
tline, an animation studio I started together with a good friend of mine, a=
nd we want to tell you about the possibilities of animation. A picture spea=
ks more than a thousand words. You have probably heard this sentence before=
, a subject or concept is easily translated to images. This is possible thr=
ough video, photo but also with illustration and animation. We are speciali=
sed in an illustrative form of animation: Explanimations. These are animati=
ons which make your product or service clear, they show what you want to ac=
hieve. An explanimation doesn't only look good on your site, but also on so=
cial media; the place where everyone is at. Many other companies invest in =
an animation video because clients don't have time or don't feel like readi=
ng a bunch of text. They'd rather sit back, watch and listen. People today =
also generally read less but watch more, you don't see a lot of people read=
ing the newspaper anymore, but everyone is watching videos. You can also ma=
ke a short real-life-action video, but we often see that animation is more =
clear, cheaper and looks a lot more hip! We can help you with making an exp=
lanimation. From concept to full-fledged end product, we take care of every=
thing; fast and effective. Take a look at our site so you can see what we a=
re capable of: www.theoutline.tv If you want to know more or would like to =
contact us, you can send us a mail at camiel@theoutline.tv (please don't re=
ply to this present email as this Inbox isn't monitored) Hope to hear from =
you soon! Thanks, Camiel Ayari=0A=0A--=0AThis e-mail was sent from a contac=
t form on Andre Duvoisin (http://andreduvoisin.com)
