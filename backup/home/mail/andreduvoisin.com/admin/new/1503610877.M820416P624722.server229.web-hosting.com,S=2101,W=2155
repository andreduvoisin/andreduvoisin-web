Message Body:
Hi,

Do you care about your WordPress website? 

You WordPress website is your asset. However, do you guard it?

Did you know that 73 per cent of the 40,000  popular websites that use WordPress are vulnerable to attack?

You can easily (and VERY inexpensively) get rid of this problem right now:   http://clktr4ck.com/safewp

Yes, here is the unpleasant truth: while WordPress is awesome, it’s not secure at all. But the great news is that you can easily make your site safe.

Go to:   http://clktr4ck.com/safewp
…to learn how you can easily secure your WordPress site for a price of latte.

Best regards,
Loren

P.S. This is your chance to take care of WordPress security (or should I say insecurity?) issues once and for all.
