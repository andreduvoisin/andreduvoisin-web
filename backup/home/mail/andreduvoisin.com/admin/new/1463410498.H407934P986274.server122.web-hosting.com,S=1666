Message Body:
Hello, I tried calling you several times today, and I'm not getting through for some reason. If your website does not have many Facebook Likes, why would someone visit your Facebook Fanpage? People Like you when other people like you. The more people that LIKE your website and fanpage on Facebook, the more credibility you will have with new visitors. It works the same for Twitter, Instagram and Youtube. When people visit your page and see that you have a lot of followers, they now want to follow you too. They too want to know what all the hype is and why all those people are following you. Get some free likes, followers, and views just for trying this service I found: http://yourls.endinahosting.com/zupe
