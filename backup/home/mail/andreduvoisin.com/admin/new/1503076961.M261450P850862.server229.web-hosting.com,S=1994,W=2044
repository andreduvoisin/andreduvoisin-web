Message Body:
Dear Patriot,

The TSA is saying [this little knife] is making them crazy??
>> Check It Out Closer Right Here:  http://bit.ly/2fFveOw
Why?
Because... they can't detect them!

Our friends at Survival Life are giving away 8000 FREE credit card knives as their way of saying thank you to those blue rubber glove lovers slowing us down at airports everywhere.

>>> This free cool knife is something that would make James Bond proud:  http://bit.ly/2fFveOw

P.S. Better get yours while you still canâ€¦

Best,
Rich
