Message Body:
Hi!

I know you're busy so I'll keep this brief. I was looking at your page (andreduvoisin.com) and noticed some glaring errors thats preventing your potential customers from being able to contact you..you're losing out on alot of potential clients because they can't find you. What I want to do for you is to give you a free website audit so you know exactly what you need to do to fix those issues so your website can start being shown higher on Google, which means when a potential client searches for a service you do, they'd be able to find and contact you. Usually I charge $97 for this website audit, but I won't charge you anything for it. There's only a few spots left, so please go to my website http://www.auditmywebsite.com right now and and claim your free website audit.

I'll talk to you again soon!
Jessica Francine
