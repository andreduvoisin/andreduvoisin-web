Message Body:
I went through http://andreduvoisin.com yesterday and just wondered if youve done any search engine marketing yet. I am self employed doing that for various businesses for a number of years now, its been putting food on the table so I wont complain.

I do quite a few things differently than other players in the industry do. I can place you on the first page of Google in most cases immediately using methods that has taken me years to perfect. Ill get you to rank naturally by improving the number and quality of inbound links, on site content, social media involvement, video creation and PPC optimization should you use that.

I do have a few tools that most people dont use or know about that Id like to use for your site.  Let me know if youd like more information, I have plenty of examples I can show you.
