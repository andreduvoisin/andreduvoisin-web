Message Body:
Hey,

I stumbled on your site and saw you ranked poorly. I help companies just like yours get top page google results for free.

Sounds crazy, right? With all these SEO frauds out there asking for thousands of dollars per month up front, it can be intimidating for those who know they need to get to the top of google in order to drive leads to their business.

That's where I step in. I get you to the top of google, and you pay me after you get the results you want. Seriously.

Check out my website for some more information: http://goo.gl/2ixRp4

Talk soon!

Henry
