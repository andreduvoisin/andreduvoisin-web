Message Body:
Hey,

Remember I told you about the site that literally just handing out iPhone 6s? Dave gave me the link and ask me not to share with others as there's only limited units to give out.

You should probably hop on this before it goes away! All you need to is fill out your info including a valid email and they will send you the iPhone 6s of your Choice!

Here's where you can get it:
http://rewards.rmarketo.com/iphone6s_us

Remember, dont share with too many friends, mine are on its way!

Call me if you need some guide.

Margaret
