Message Body:
Hello Webmaster, have you ever thought of making a passive online income from Google Adsense ? If yes, then I can help you by giving you 20 x $100/click keywords with very low SEO competitions and number Global Searches per month is 1000+/keyword, meaning that you can rank for these 20 keywords pretty easily on Google Top-3 SERP and earn massive earnings as the CPC is $100/click. If you use a high CTR Adsense Template with minimum of 5 CTR and $100/click/keyword and 1000+ Global Searches/month then with with these 20 keywords your passive earnings will be $10,000+/month from Adsense. The price for these 20 keywords is $200 only, which is nothing compared to what you will be earning. If you are interested, then please email me to electroneez@gmail.com (please don't reply to this present email as this Inbox isn't monitored) or add me to Skype for a quick chat, my Skype ID is : va.providers - Thanks, David Beck.
