Message Body:
Hello

I heard from Steve Hill that andreduvoisin.com is really worth of visit.

I am looking for websites like yours to be added our 'interesting websites' section on our super popular LinkedIn article.

I know, the "super popular" phrase is totally overused these days... But I think our 2.4 million readers on LinkedIn justifies use of that phrase ;)

This, of course, does not cost you anything as we just want to keep our millions of business readers entertained with interesting websites.


You can see the LinkedIn article in question by clicking the following link and selecting an icon with text "Make 3x more sales leads from your website? Easy...":

If I am allowed to add a link to our LinkedIn article towards your web site, please email me! 


Thanking you in advance,

Andrew Jones
