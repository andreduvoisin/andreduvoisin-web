se help us to stop mass murdering of wild horses=0A=0AMessage Body:=0AThe m=
ass killing of 45,000 wild horses and burros could become reality if the Bu=
reau of Land Management (BLM) has its way. On September 9, 2016 the BLM=
=E2=80=99s Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Board recommended killing of captu=
red wild horses and burros as an =E2=80=9Cemergency=E2=80=9D measure. The a=
gency wants to clear the holding pens so that it can round up 40,000 more w=
ild horses and burros from their homes on the range. Hours before the recom=
mendation, the BLM cancelled cruel sterilization experiments on wild mares =
amidst growing public outrage and a barrage of lawsuits.=C2=A0Now the agenc=
y is focusing on mass killing of these national icons, but can only do so=
=C2=A0if Congress and the Administration authorize this lethal and heartles=
s plan. The American people will not stand for this. Tell the Administratio=
n and Congress that we want our wild horses and burros protected and preser=
ved on our public lands, not rounded up and killed or sold for brutal slaug=
hter. Please sign the petition at https://www.change.org/search?q=3Dmass20k=
