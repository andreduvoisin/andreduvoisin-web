Subject: Tried calling…

Message Body:
Hello, I tried calling but it seems no one really wants to talk on the phone these days so I thought I would email instead… :) I think this idea, being so hot on social media these days, would be the perfect business marketing tool. Check it out https://www.promomotive.com/blogs/tech-promo-ideas/promotional-popsockets-propring-and-pop-phone-grips I think it may be right for your business….? If it is, let me know and we can get you samples etc …thanks…I really appreciate your support. Please email me to john@promocrunch.com (don't reply to this email as this Inbox isn't monitored.) John "Hopelessly Happy" Graham
