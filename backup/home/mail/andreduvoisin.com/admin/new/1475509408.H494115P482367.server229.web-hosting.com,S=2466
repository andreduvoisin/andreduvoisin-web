I didn't like. They said  that spun content was dead. From now on, they sai=
d, you should manually create  *ALL* your articles. Is this the end of Inte=
rnet Marketing as we know it?! <br /><br />Not for me. <span style=3D"text-=
decoration: underline;">I need TONS of content every day</span>. I publish =
it on my 50 +  sites . <br /><br />It's simply IMPOSSIBLE  to manually writ=
e that much content. Day in and day out. <br /><br /> Luckily, the author o=
f the article is VERY wrong. It's true that *poorly* spun content is dead. =
Google can detect it. Nothing new here. <br /><br />But, if the content is =
spun with the ENL semantic spinning algorithm, Google can't detect it. Why?=
 <br /><br />Because it looks just like a native speaker had rewritten it. =
