Message Body:
Hey!

I've found an opportunity for you
to work from the comfort of your own
lounge and potentially earn $20/hour..

I say potential because this isnâ€™t a 
salaried position. It involves working 
for yourself and you could earn a lot 
more or less.

If you can read this email, you have
enough skills to get started.

Thanks,

Donald Larson
