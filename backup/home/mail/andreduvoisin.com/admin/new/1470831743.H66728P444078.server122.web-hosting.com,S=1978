Message Body:
Hello Friend,   How are you?  It took me awhile to respond because i was on holliday with my family, Greece was lovely but the weather got us the last few days! Ok here is you answer. Creating deacent amount of  money with Amazon Kindle is not an easy task as many people think-so i spent  few days searching for the right course that will cover all basic and intermediate stuff you need to know about publishing on kindle. To be honest my biggest monthly earnings comes from kindle, and while reviewing the product, i choose for you, it reveald to me many new tricks that i was unfamiliar of. I wanted to send you the review via email but i made it too long so i spent extra day to put more content and pictures and now its published on web2.0 blog- maybe it will come in handy to someone else too! :)Here is the link (hope you will enjoy it)--> http://goo.gl/xH1NUI   All the best , Mark
