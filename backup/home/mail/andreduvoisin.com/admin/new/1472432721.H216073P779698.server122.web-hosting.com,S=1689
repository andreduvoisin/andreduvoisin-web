Message Body:
Semrush is the swiss army knife of online competitor research. I use the tool every day for personal and client SEO/PPC campaigns. It allows you to get an (almost unfair) behind-the-scenes look at your top performing competitors and use the insights to build profitable online marketing campaigns right from the beginning.  Find profitable keyword opportunities, pinpoint high-converting ad and landing page copy, dissect competitor content strategies, audit backlink profiles, identify new site monetization opportunities, track metrics in real-time...and a lot more.get you free 30 day trial  http://bit.ly/2bZhHvj
