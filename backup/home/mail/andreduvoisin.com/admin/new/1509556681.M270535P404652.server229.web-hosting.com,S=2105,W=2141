Message Body:
Greetings, I am reaching out to you again regarding the Software & Technology Awards 2017. As mentioned before, a vote was received via our nomination form on your firm's behalf, but unfortunately no contact email was provided with the entry. I wanted to find out whether you’d like to accept the nomination and proceed to our shortlist. We are set to close shortlisting and delete all remaining nominations in November, so please get in touch referencing ST104 on the above email, or call me directly on +44203 725 6847 if it is something you’d like to accept or hear more about. I thank you for your time and look forward to hearing from you soon, Kaven Cooper
