essage Body:=0AWHAT IS THE CANDETOX PROGRAM? Candetox is a 56 day Candida d=
etox program. Candetox uses Lufenuron to attack Candida, toxins and parasit=
es deep within the body. As the Lufenuron takes effect in the body, additio=
nal toxin-removing support, such as Zeolite, Probiotics and Charcoal are us=
ed to help remove these toxins, fungus and parasites and restore balance Sy=
stemic Candida is a condition whereby Candida fungus has infiltrated many, =
if not all of the body=E2=80=99s systems. The body=E2=80=99s pH is compromi=
sed, dropping under 6.5 and in turn switching off up to 90 of the immune sy=
stem. Candida needs an acidic environment to flourish. Removing Candida hel=
ps to alkalize the body and reignite the immune system. Most people have a =
body pH of around 6.25. At this level, only 10 of the immune system is oper=
ating, making it necessary for people to rely on antibiotics and other drug=
s to combat disease. The goal of the Candetox Candida Detox Program is to e=
liminate as much Candida as possible, as well as remove heavy metal toxins =
and other parasites, viruses and bacteria that have lodged within the body.=
 In addition, the Candetox Program aims to alkalize the body so that Candid=
a can no longer survive. With diet and alkalizing support, the body can ree=
stablish its natural pH balance. On a daily basis we are exposed to toxins,=
 bacteria, parasites and viruses. These range from environmental pollutants=
, to food additives, air-born germs and chemical contamination. Even if you=
 live a very healthy lifestyle, you are still exposed to a myriad of chemic=
als and toxins; some that may have been lodged in your body since you were =
a child. Each time a toxin or parasite enters the body, the immune system d=
efends by automatically creating a fungus around that organism/toxin. This =
fungus then creates its own protective Chitin shell in order to survive. Al=
though the body is trying to help, this fungus and surrounding Chitin shell=
 provide a safe environment for those toxins and parasites to survive withi=
n. Candetox Lufenuron breaks down the Chitin shell so your body can then el=
iminate these damaging toxins and the surrounding fungus. August Sales all =
