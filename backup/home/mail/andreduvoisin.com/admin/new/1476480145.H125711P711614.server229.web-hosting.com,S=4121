From: Ronald Whiteman <woafn@europe.com>=0ASubject: EXTREMELY URGENT - We n=
eed to move these 300 dogs from the war zone=0A=0AMessage Body:=0AThey've b=
een shot at ... had bombs raining down around them ... and a large section =
of their shelter in Gorlovka burned to the ground. Dogs have died and suffe=
red terrible injuries, and they live in constant fear. Enough is enough! No=
w we urgently need to move these 300 desperate dogs from their shelter on t=
he front lines of Ukraine's war and into a safer area. But we must hurry - =
the harsh Ukraine winter is about to set in. With your gift, we'll be able =
to buy the transport crates they need, provide them with all the veterinary=
 care they need, and move the dogs and the shelter's supplies and equipment=
. Your gift will be used immediately to help save animal lives everywhere w=
e work. After the shelter fire, so many supporters asked if we could find a=
 way to move the shelter out of harm's way. We worked on it for months, and=
 finally found a suitable location. Then a generous IFAW donor stepped up t=
o pay for the land. Now we just need to move the dogs, supplies and equipme=
nt. Sweet souls like Aisya and Gabba can't wait any longer. I've written ab=
out poor Aisya before. She was shot when soldiers raided the shelter and st=
ole supplies. She survived, and now I'm hoping we can move her away from th=
is deadly danger.And then there's Gabba, who has lived at the shelter since=
 she was a puppy. She developed terrible skin issues from the stress of the=
 continuous bombings around the shelter. She deserves a safe home ... all o=
f the dogs do! I estimate that it will cost about $50 to move each dog. A g=
ift of that much, as soon as possible, could help us start this move and he=
lp so many animals that need you. Of course, a gift of any amount will help=
 do so much for animals that are in desperate need, and help the Gorlovka s=
helter caregivers begin moving the dogs and equipment to the safe new locat=
ion. That location is away from the fighting and closer to an area where th=
ere are many more potential adopters for these wonderful dogs. I so look fo=
rward to the day that I can tell you that Aisya, Gabba, and other dogs have=
 found loving new homes. Until then, they need to be kept safe, warm, fed a=
nd cared for. You could help us do that. But please hurry. Time is running =
out and I'm afraid they'll never make it through another winter. Thank you =
for caring about these dogs, and helping us save and protect so many animal=
s in need. You can make your donation which will help SAVE LIVES OF THESE S=
WEETIES at https://www.ifaw.org/united-states/secure/donate/help-ukraine-do=
gs  P.S. The shelter workers risk their lives to help these dogs. We owe it=
 to them, and to the frightened dogs, to move the shelter before winter set=
s in. Please give today to help these dogs, and all the animals that need u=
s. Have a great day. Thank you very much, in advance. Best regards Ronald W=
