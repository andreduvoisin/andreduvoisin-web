Message Body:
Hey there,

I am Jessica; friend of Alex, he asked me to contact you about what I found, also said that you do business online and I should write through site.

I found new innovation http://infograph.ly/ , as you can see in video on the site, it can generate infographics based on keywords and do that automatically. I think this is game changer for internet marketing because to make one infographic with tools available is expensive and takes a day now. But these guys offer it under 60 sec automatically. As you probably know 2015 is year of infographics, so I think this tool will be must-have.

That's all I wanted to share, hopefully it will help you and Alex!

Thank You for Your time!

Best Regards,
Jessica Falarski
