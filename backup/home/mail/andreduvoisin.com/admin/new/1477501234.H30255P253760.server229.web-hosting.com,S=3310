ey are one of the only animal protection groups still operating while the c=
ivil war rages on. They face a huge challenge. Every day they are confronte=
d by fresh dead carcasses on the street - innocent, young dogs and cats who=
 have died slowly from internal bleeding (indicated by blood pouring out of=
 the anus), others with multiple gunshot wounds. People who are irritated b=
y the growing homeless animal population are taking it upon themselves to k=
ill countless innocent doggies and cats with guns and poisoned meat. Many o=
f these dogs and cats used to have homes before their human families were k=
illed or had to flee the country in a hurry. Our Syrian partners are standi=
ng by to do more to help these innocent, forgotten dogs and cats =E2=80=

p these killing sprees and they will rescue the lucky ones who have somehow=
