Message Body:
Hi,
Shocking new scientific research uncovered how to treat the root cause of diabetes. Doctors at the International Council for Truth in Medicine have perfected these diabetes treatment methods:
In 16 days, patients insulin dosages were reduced by over 57
A few weeks later, 96 of patients were able to stop ALL diabetes drugs and injections.
Blood sugar normalized, insulin sensitivity increased and neuropathy pain went away.
They've already helped over 17,542 type 2 diabetics end the need for prescription drugs, insulin injections and blood sugar monitoring.
But you won't hear about this breakthrough from your doctor.

Take care,
