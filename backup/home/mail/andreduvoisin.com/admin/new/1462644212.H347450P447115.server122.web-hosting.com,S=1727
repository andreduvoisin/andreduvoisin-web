Message Body:
Hi, I just studied your website and I wanted to shoot you a quick note. If it would help your business any, I can make a few changes aesthetically, and/or SEO-wise to make your website convert more visitors into leads for you, and to get it placed higher by 175 percent in the organic search results for select terms that are already receiving large sums or searches per month. Would it be ok if I got you more information through a short phone call to get you a quick quote for what I am looking to accomplish?  We guarantee 1st page exposure in most of our packages as well.  I am looking forward to your ‘yes’ reply.  I look forward to speaking with you soon. Tammie Marbley– Website Traffic Specialist
