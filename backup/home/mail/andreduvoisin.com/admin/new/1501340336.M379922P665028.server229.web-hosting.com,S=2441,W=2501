Message Body:
Hi, 
 
This is Marcelino from 3001 Inc. 
 
While analyzing a few random sites to gather data for our SEO analyzer software development, I came across andreduvoisin.com and found 34 errors that can affect the site's speed and rankings in Google search results. 
 
Here are some of the errors:
 
Too many file requests
HTML is not W3C validated
Text to HTML ratio is too low (< 25)
 
I couldn't attach a screenshot of your website's analysis result using this contact form but you can scan it online using our software and see the errors yourself here: 
 
http://www.3001data.com/scan 
 
After scanning your website, our software will send you a report which contains all the errors and how to fix them. 

You can use it to analyze and fix errors on as many pages on your site as you want. Scanning your site will also give us the neccessary data to help us develop the software further. 
 
Please email me at Marcelino@3001data.com if you have any questions or feedback. 
 
Have a nice day! 
Marcelino 
Project Manager 
3001 Inc.
