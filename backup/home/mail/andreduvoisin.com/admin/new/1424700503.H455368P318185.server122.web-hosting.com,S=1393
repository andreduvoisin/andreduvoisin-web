Message Body:
Sorry if you got this message twice, the page gave me an error so I am trying to send again. I am a software developer and I noticed that your site is made with Wordpress. What if you could literally rank for any word in Google with just a simple to install plugin and a few easy steps? Check out my Tumblr post and hey, what have you got to lose! http://bestseotactics.tumblr.com/post/111789036428/rank-with-a-push-of-a-button
