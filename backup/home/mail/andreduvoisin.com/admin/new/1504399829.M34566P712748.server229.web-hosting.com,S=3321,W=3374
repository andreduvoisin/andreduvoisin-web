appers=0A=0AMessage Body:=0ADear Madam, Dear Sir Please help us to STOP HOR=
RIBLE TORTURING AND MURDERING OF SWEET ARCTIC FOXES AND OTHER INNOCENT ANIM=
ALS in fur farms and by human monsters - trappers. On fur farms, animals ar=
e confined to cramped, filthy cages that are often exposed to all weather e=
xtremes. They are crudely killed by poisoning, electrocution, neck-breaking=
, and suffocation. This doesn't always kill them outright, and many are SKI=
NNED ALIVE!!! Animals trapped in the wild have it no better and face blood =
loss, shock, dehydration, frostbite, gangrene, and attacks by predators aft=
er stepping into steel-jaw traps or wire snares. They may wait in agony for=
 days before being strangled, stomped on, shot, or bludgeoned to death when=
 the trappers return. There isn't a single federal humane-slaughter law to =
protect animals who are killed for their fur, yet you made the decision to =
continue purchasing and selling fur. Please join the hundreds of fur-free d=
esigners and retailers that refuse to sell any fur or fur-trimmed clothing =
or accessories. Until you do, I'll be shopping elsewhere, and I will tell m=
y friends and family to do the same. Please check https://www.peta.org/blog=
/undercover-photos-arctic-foxes-finland-fur-farms for more information abou=
t horrible torturing and murdering of arctic foxex and other animals caused=
 by human monsters who are making their bloody money by such barbaric way. =
Please BOYCOTT any products made or decorated by a fur from these TORTURED =
AND MURDERED INNOCENT ANIMALS. Thank you very much for your help in this ma=
tter. Have a great day. Best regards Dr. Reinhardt Von THIESSE, ANIMAL RESC=
