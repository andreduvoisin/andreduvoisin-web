### Overview

As a final project for an agent-focused multithreaded programming course, our team of 8 people created a city simulation that would run independent of human input. The city had many different facets:

- Citizens who eat, sleep, pay their rent, have jobs, travel about the city, go to the market, visit the bank, and go to restaurants.
- 8 restaurants that citizens may choose to eat at.
- A market that citizens may buy food or cars at.
- A bus system to traverse the city.
- A control panel that controlled things like number of citizens and different real-world scenarios (e.g. a restaurant runs out of food).
