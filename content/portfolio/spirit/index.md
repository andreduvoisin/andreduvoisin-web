Spirit is a free-flowing rhythm game created for iOS. The player traverses the cosmos as Spirit and taps on the screen when Spirit comes in contact with a pad, which are laid out to the beat of the song. Keeping the rhythm is essential to maintaining your flow.

Spirit was developed with Unity in a 3-person team - two engineers and a sound designer.

### Contributions

- Wrote a sound wave analyzer in order to distinguish the strong beats in a given sound file.
- Dynamic level generation based on the timing of the beats.
- Spirit movement from pad to pad throughout the levels.
- Scoring system based on input timing.
  - "Sweetspotting" the pads netted more points.
- Overall game flow: traversing the level, pad input timing, and beginning/death/end states.
- UI and Menu system
