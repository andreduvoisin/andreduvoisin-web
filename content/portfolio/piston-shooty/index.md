Piston Shooty is a 2D puzzle game where the player shoots guns that each shoot more guns. When they're ready, the player can spend their one bullet shot - which shoots a bullet out of all guns in play at once! Can they time their bullet shot accurately to kill all enemies in one click?

Puns are a non-negotiable. Every level name and gun name must be pun-based. Here's our current running [list of puns](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o4KA7FMiAnsUhNSu8TVDPX4hDut6xDh9fK15ulkDJVI/edit)! (Now accepting lowbrow comments and suggestions. Puns must be level 7 or higher to be accepted.)

Piston Shooty is created by [Dru Erridge](http://druerridge.com/) and me. The game is written in Rust and utilizes the [Piston](https://www.piston.rs/) game engine.
