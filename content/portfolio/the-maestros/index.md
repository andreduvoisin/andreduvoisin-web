The Maestros is a fast-paced 3v3 real time strategy game in which killing neutral enemies gives the player base units that can then be transformed into more powerful units. Each player controls a commander who has unique abilities and supplements their army. Players can customize their strategy by choosing between 6 different commanders and a selection of 12 units on 2 unique races. Kill enemy commanders to score points and win!

The Maestros was created on a team of 35 people using Unreal Development Kit (UDK).

It was released for PC on Steam. See the Links section below for more details!

### Contributions

- Implemented the user interface for the main menu, lobby, commander selection, and in-game heads-up display (HUD) using Scaleform GFx, UnrealScript, ActionScript 3, and Flash
- Deigned and created the front-end for a 3D Main Menu system
- Implemented the front-end for a login system with session information
- Integrated against a web API using HTTP and TCP to form a working lobby system. Lobby flow includes:
  - Creating a lobby or selecting from a list of available lobbies.
  - Changing and replicating game settings (e.g. Game Mode, Team Select)
  - Lobby chat
  - Commander select with live updates to teammates, so that you may see which commanders your teammates are choosing before locking in.
  - After everyone locks in their commander, a message is sent to the lobby server to transition to the game. The client connects to the game server upon receiving its network information from the lobby server.
- In-game status overlay with information such as kills, deaths, assists, commander information, and army composition information.
- In-game pause menu
- Victory and defeat overlays
- Post-game score screen with final match results and statistics.
