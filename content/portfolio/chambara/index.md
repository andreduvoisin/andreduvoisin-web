Chambara is a networked multiplayer stealth-deathmatch game with only two colors, allowing players to seamlessly camouflage themselves with the environment. This empowers players to sneak, search, and ambush each other in dramatic, stylish duels.

Chambara was created with a team of 20 people. The front end uses Unity3D, while the back end consists of Node.js and MongoDB on Linux.
