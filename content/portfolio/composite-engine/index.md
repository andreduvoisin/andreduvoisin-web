Composite Engine is a game engine technical demo created to explore the core low-level components required to make a video game, while attempting to push the envelope on some of the more frustrating or mundane elements. It currently sports a graphics engine, scene and camera support, an animation processing tool, an event system, and a user interface.

Composite Engine is created by [Kevin Viglucci](https://viglucci.io/) and me. The engine is written in C++ for Windows and Mac and features OpenGL, a CMake build system, and Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) for a JavaScript user interface layer.

### Contributions

- Graphics engine with rendering, texturing, skinning, and animations in OpenGL
- Animation processing tool to import via FBX SDK and export to a custom format
- Event system to marshal events between different engine systems
- CMake build and dependency management system for Windows and Mac
- Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) integration to support a JavaScript user interface with React and Redux
