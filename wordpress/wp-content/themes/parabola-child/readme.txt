In the event of an update, the updated frontpage.php from the parent theme 
will need to be pulled down, the changes specified by ANDRE_CHANGED from the old
frontpage.php will need to be made in the new frontpage.php, and the new 
frontpage.php will need to be uploaded to the child theme directory.
